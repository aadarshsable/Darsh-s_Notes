**Hypothesis**:
> a proposes explanation for a set of observations, and it leads to predictions that can be tested by making additional observations or by performing experiments

An important point about scientific inquiry is that we can never *prove* that a Hypothesis is true

But Note, **Theory** is different from a hypothesis in a sense
> Theory is much broader in scope and supposes by a large and usually growing body of evidence.
> And is not contradicted by any scientific data

$Q.$ What is the main requirement for a scientifc hypothesis?
$Ans.$   it must generate predfictions that can be tested by experiments 
          or gathering further observations


### Hypothesis can be tested using controlled experiments

Controlled experiments are performed which are based on Independent variables and Dependent variables

```ad-note
title: Controlled experiment of two species of mice living  in different environment.

The Beach mouse (white) lives on shore while inland mouse (brown) lives in dark soil
We can see the mice body colour matches somewhat to their environment
In 2010, Hopi Hoekstra examined her camouflage hypothesis and predicted it was due to survibility of the mice


```

**Cohort:**
> A group of Humans selected for a controlled study with some similarities related to the study


$Q.$ In some studies, researchers try to match the sex, age, and general health of subjects in the control and experimental groups. What is this experimental design trying to do?

> Ensure that the two groups differ only in the one variable the expeirment is designed to test
