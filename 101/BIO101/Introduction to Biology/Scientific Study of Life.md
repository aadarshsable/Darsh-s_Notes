## How would you define life?

 Life can be characterised by its properties and processes such as 
 
 1. **Reproduction**: organisms reproducing their own kind
  2. **Order**: Life is characterized by highly ordered structures
  3. **Growth & Development**: Inherited DNA controls pattern of growth and development
  4. **Response to the environment**: to the environment stimulus.
  5. **Energy Processing**: organisms take in energy and use it for their activities
  6. **Regulation**: Regulatory mechnaisms that maintain a beneficial internal environment
  7. **Evolutionary Adaptation**: evolution over generations as individuals with heritable traits that are best suited to their environment and have greater reproductive success

## Diversity of Life in three Domains

Each unique form of life is called a **species**

Approximately 1.8 million species have been identified and named to date, and thousands more are identified each year
Esitmates of the total number of species that actually exist range from 10 million to over 100 million

***Taxonomy***: 
>branch of biology that names and classifies species and arranges species into a hierrachy of broader groups

Main goal for such classification is to reflect the evolutionary history and relationship of organisms

##### Domains:
- ***Domain Bacteria***
	  simple cells
- ***Domain Archaea***
	 simple cells
	 lives in Earth's extreme environments like salty lakes and boiling hot springs
- ***Domain Eukarya***
	  complex cells
	 **Protists** are a diverse collection of mostly single-celled organisms
	 The groups in Eukarya are distinguished partly by their modes of nutrition.
	 - **Kindgom Plantae** consists of Plants which produce their own food
	 - **Kingdom Fungi** who mostly decompose organic waste and absorb the nutrients into their cells
	 - **Kingdom Animalia** obtain their food by eating other organisms

## Theme: Feedback mechanisms regulate biological systems

Feedback mechanisms allows biological processes to self-regulate

#### Positive Feedback
As more of a product accumulates, the process that creates it speeds up and more of the product is produced

#### Negative Feedback
As more of a product accumulates, the process that creates it slows and less of the product is produced
