## Evolution is the Core Theme of Biology

### Darwins Theory of Evolution:

Darwin published *On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selction.* in November 1859

He collected documented plants animnals and fossil data from the isolated GalÃ¡pagos Islands to the heights of the Anded Mountains to the Rain Forest in Brazel

The species living today arose from a succession of ancestors that were
different from them.
Which he called **Descent with Modification** (modification that evoled as species diverged from their ancestors)
Which also includes **Descent from a common ancestors**

He also proposed a Mechanism for evolution which he called ***Natural Selection***	   

##### Darwins Two Observations

1. ***Individual Variation***: Individuals in a population vary in their traits, many of which seem to be heritable
	   **Inference:** 
	   ***Unequal Reproductive Success:*** Indivuduals with inherited traits best suited to the local environment are more likely to survive and reproduce than are less well-suited individuals
 
 2. ***Overproduction of offspring:*** All species can produce far more offspring than the environment can support. Competition for resources is thus inevitable, and many of these offspring fail to survive and reproduce
	   **Inference:**
	   ***Accumulation of favourable traits over time:*** As a result of this unequal reproductive success over many generations, a higher and higher proportion of individuals in the population will have the advantageous traits.

>He proposed that new species could evolve as a result of the gradual accumlation of changes ove rlong periods of time.

### The Tree of Life:

---Not Important?---

$Q.$ Explain the cause and effect of unequal repoductive success.
> Those individuals with heritable traits best suited to the local environment produce the greatest number of offspring. Over many generations, the proportion of these adaptive traits increase in the population

-------------------------------------

## Evolution is connected to our everday lives:

But humans also affect evolution **unintentionally**. The impact of habitat loss and climate change can be seen in the loss of species.
It is estimated that the current rate of extinction is 100-1000 times the rate seen in fossil record

For Example,
Our widespread use of anti-biotics and pesticides has led to the evolution of antibiotics resistance in bacteria and pesticide restistance in insects.

$Q.$ Explain how humans are agents of both artificial selection and natural selection
> We use artificial selection when choosing species traits or genes in organisms that we breed. Our **intentional** and **unintentional**manipulations change the environment and thus affect natural selection.

## Theme: Life depends on the flow of information

### Genetic Information

DNA provides all the instructions for the cell function and it also carries the heritable information that is to be passed from one generation to the other.

#### The Struction of DNA
- Double Helix
- The Strands are made up of Four kinds of Nucleotide Bonds (A,T,C,G)
- The Nucleotides have fixed pairing 
   A $\rightarrow$ T   &   C $\rightarrow$ G

Specific sequences of these four chemical letters encode precise information in units of inheritance called ***Genes***
Genes provide the blueprint for making ***Protiens***

Making a Protien Involves Sequincial Flow of Information

![[Pasted image 20221130034455.png]]

A gene's Information is **Transcribed** from DNA to RNA which carries it to the protien-manufacturing machinery in the cell.
There the sequence of Nucleotides in the RNA is **Translated** into a chain of Protien building blocks
The chain forms a specific protein with a unique shape and function
This Process is called ***GENE EXPRESSION***

All forms of life use essentially the same chemical language to translate the information stored in DNA into Proties called the **Genetic Code**.

----------------------------------

### Signaling Information

The flow of genetic Information from DNA to RNA to Protien is liked with information from the external and internal environment.
(For example - Stimulus)

```ad-note
title: Note
All Body cells have the same genetic information, but the gene for some specific function (Ex Insulin in Pancreas) is only "expressed" in those specific areas/organs.
```

Information Signaling in Pancreas in case of sugar intake
- After a meal, the level of glucose in blood rises $\rightarrow$
- This internal signal stimulates cells in your pancreas to secrete insulin which travels through blood $\rightarrow$ 
- Insulin binds to receptors on body cell causing them to take up glucose $\rightarrow$
- The lowered glucose level removes the signal and insulin secretion decreases

$Q.$ How is signaling Information involved in the expression of genetic information?
> Information from the internal and external environment affect gene expression, where and when particular genes are activated and proteins made

------------------------------------

## Theme: Structure and Function are Related

***Example-1***
At the molecular level, the structure of a protein correlates with its function, whether it is part of the strong ligaments holding your bones together or the hemoglobin molecules transporting oxygen in your blood.

***Example-2***
On the cellular level, the long extensions of nerve cells enable them to transmit impulses from your spinal cord to your toes.

***Example-3***
The long, thin cells of fungi enable them to extend through their food source and absorb nutrients.

***Example-4***
The thick walls surrounding plant cells provide structural support to the plant leaf, just as the tough exoskeleton of the beetle supports its body.

***Example-5***
A Red Panda has a small bone protruding from its wrist caled the **Radial Sesamoi** (or the "false thumb").
It helps them to grasp bamboo. This evoled in the red panda's carnivorous ancestor as an adaptation that enabled it to move along branches in trees.
Secondarily, it enabled the plant-eating Red Panda to hold onto bamboo.
> The giant panda also has a "flase thumb" just much larger
> This with the bamboo diet led biologists to clasify the red panda and giant panda as close relatives
> However, fossil and DNA evidence indicate that these similar structural adaptation evolved separately in the two distinct lineages

The Close match of form and function in structures of life can be explained by natural selection

------------------------------------------

## Theme: Life depends on the transfer and transformation of energy and matter

The dynamics of ecosystem can be summarized with two major processes-
***The flow of Energy*** and ***Cycling of Matter***
An ecosystem gains and loses energy constantly.
Energy flows through an ecosystem in one direction, generally entering as light and exiting as heat (In our case) 

#### The Chemical Square dance
In which molecules swap chemical partners as they recieve, convert and release energy is never-ending in all forms of life


------------------------------------

## Theme: Life depends on interactions within and between systems

As we move up through the heirarchy, we see that novel properties emerge at each higher level.
The emergent properties of each level result from the specific arrangement and interactions of its part.
Such a combination of components forms a more complex organization is called a ***SYSTEM***
	The human body is a system with interactions between the organs,tissues... that allow it to maintain a relatively stable internal environment

Disruption in the components can lead to disease.
**Example** - 
	Type1 Diabetes is the result of pancreatic cells no longer producing insulin
	Type2 Diabetes develops when body cells no longer respong to insulin

Using ***Systems Biology*** , a model for behavior of biological systems by analyzing the interaction among their parts was made.

It approaches questions such as:
	- How does a drug for blood pressure affect other organs
	- How does increasing $CO_{2}$ alter the biosphere?


**Example** - 
	Researchers have produced a complex systems map of the interactions among 2,346 proteins in a fruit fly cell, based on huge database of known proteins and their actions.
One of the goal for such model is to predict how a change in one component will affect the other parts of the system.

Life is characterized by interconnections and interactions.

$Q.$ A box of bicycle parts won't do anything, but if the parts are properly asembled, you can take a ride. What does this illustrate.
> Emergent properties of the interacting components of a system.
