## Membranes are fluid mosaics of lipids and proteins with many functions

Biologists use the fluid mosaic model to describe a membrane's structure 
i.e, a diverse protein molecules suspended in a fluid phsopholipid bilayer.
This model illustrates the structure and function of a plasma membrane.

[Fluid Mosaic Model](<Fluid Mosaic Model>)

The ***Lipid Bilayer model*** is a subset of ***Fluid Mosaic Model*** as it also contains Lipid Bilayers but with additional **Proteins** and **Glycolipids**
Additional **Gobular Proteins** aree also embedded into the lipid bilayer

### Cell Recognition
- The **Glycolipids** & **Glycoproteins** also help in cell recognition
- They are usually branched *oligosaccharides* (<15 monomers)
- They are covalently bonded to lipids and proteins respectively

## The spontaneous formation of membranes was a critical step in the origin of life

#### Phospholipids
- Among the first organic molecules that formed from chemical reactions on early Earth
- These lipids could spontaneously self-assemble into simple membranes.
	  We can demonstrate this by shaking phospholipids and water. The lipids will form a bilayer surrounding around water-filled bubbles

- The Phospholipids can arrange themselves latteraly very easily and move faster than the proteins

### Types of Phospholipids

$Q.$ *What is the basic requirement for life to form?*
> A membrane that not only encolses a successful assembly of molecules but also regulates chemical exchanges with the environment.
> For regulation the membrane should contain proteins embedded into it, cause only simple lipid bilayers are not sufficient

## Membrane Fluidity

#### Temperature
As Temperature decreases the phospholipids come close to each other i.e, the *distance* between them decreases, which decreases the Fluidity
Similarly, Fluidity increases with increase in Temperature

#### Cholesterol (buffer)
Cholesterol inserts itself between the phospholipids through Transmembrane Proteins
At Low Temperature, due to insertion of cholesterol the distance between the Phospholipids increases thus Fluidity increases.
At High Temperature, insertion of cholesterol brings the phospholipids close together as they were already far apart, which decreases the Fluidity

#### Saturated and Unsatured FattyAcids
Satured Fattyacids decreases the Fluidity while
Unsatured fattyacids increases the Fluidity

## Membrane Proteins

### Integral Proteins (Intrinsic)
- Directly incorporated within the lipid bilayer and tightly bound
- Provides a channel for the water-soluble substances
- ***Transmembrane Proteins & Transport Proteins***

#### 1. Ion Channel
Allows specific ion to move through water-filled pore. Most plasma membranes include specific chanells for several common ions.

#### 2. Transporter
Transports specific substances across membrane by changing shape. For Ex, Amino acids, needed to synthesize new proteins, enter body cells via transporters

#### 3. Receptor
Recognizes specific ligand and alters cell's fucntion is one way. For ex, Antiduretic hormone binds to rececptors in the kidneys and changes the water permeability of certain plasma membranes.

#### 4. Enzyme
Catalyzes reaciton isnide or outside cell. For Ex, lactase protruding from epithelial cells lining your small intestine splits the dissacharide lactose in the milk you drinki

#### 5. Linker
Anchors filaments inside and outside to the plasma membrane, providing structural stability. May also participate in movement of the cell or link two cells together.


### Peripheral Proteins (Extrinsic)
- On Membrane surface and located entirely outside of the lipid bilayer
- Either on the extracellular or cytoplasmic surface

#### 1. Cell identity Marker
Distinguishes your cells from anyone else's. (***Unless an identical Twin***).
An important class of such markers are the major histrocompatability (MHC) Proteins


### Transport Protein

![[Pasted image 20221217135244.png]]

- Composed of Lipids, Proteins and Carbohydrates
- Lipids of cell membrane are
  - Phospholipids
  - Glycolipids
  - Sterol 
  - Cholesterol

## Passive Transport is diffusion across a membrane with no energy investment

***Diffusion:*** 
- The tendency for particles of any substance to spread out into the available space
- Two or more subtances diffuse independenty of each other, i.e, each diffuses down its own concentration gradient
- Because cell does not have to do work when molecules diffuse across its membrane, such movement is caled ***PASSIVE TRANSPORT***
  i.e, the cells does not expend energy to transport substances that are diffusing down their concentration levels
- Much of the **Traffic** across membranes occurs by diffusion.

$Q.$ Can ions and polar molecules also diffuse across the hydrophobic interior of a membrane?
> They can if they are moving down their concentration gradients and if they have tranport proteins to help them cross.

We know what Osmosis is :)
