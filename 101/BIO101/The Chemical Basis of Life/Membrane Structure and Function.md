## Membranes are fluid mosaics of lipids and proteins with many functions

Biologists use the fluid mosaic model to describe a membrane's structure 
i.e, a diverse protein molecules suspended ina fluid phsopholipid bilayer.
This model illustrates the structure and function of a plasma membrane.

## The spontaneous formation of membranes was a critical step in the origin of life

#### Phospholipids
- Among the first organic molecules that formed from chemical reactions on early Earth
- These lipids could spontaneously self-assemble into simple membranes.
	  We can demonstrate this by shaking phospholipids and water. The lipids will form a bilayer surrounding around water-filled bubbles

$Q.$ *What is the basic requirement for life to form?*
> A membrane that not only encolses a successful assembly of molecules but also regulates chemical exchanges with the environment.
> For regulation the membrane should contain proteins embedded into it, cause only simple lipid bilayers are not sufficient

## Passive Transport is diffusion across a membrane with no energy investment

***Diffusion:*** 
- The tendency for particles of any substance to spread out into the available space
- Two or more subtances diffuse independenty of each other, i.e, each diffuses down its own concentration gradient
- Because cell does not have to do work when molecules diffuse across its membrane, such movement is caled ***PASSIVE TRANSPORT***
  i.e, the cells does not expend energy to transport substances that are diffusing down their concentration levels
- Much of the **Traffic** across membranes occurs by diffusion.

$Q.$ Can ions and polar molecules also diffuse across the hydrophobic interior of a membrane?
> They can if they are moving down their concentration gradients and if they have tranport proteins to help them cross.
