# Introduction to Biology

Overview: Inquiring About the World of Life

#### 1.1 Themes connect the concepts of biology
 - [x] Evolution, the overarching theme of biology
 - [x] Theme: New properties emerge at each level in the biological hierachy
 - [x] The biosphere
 - [x] Emergent properties
 - [ ] The power an limitations of reductionism
 - [x] Systems Biology
 - [x] Theme: Organisms interect with their environments, exchanging matter and energy (**1.13+1.14**)
 - [x] Ecosystem Dynamics
 - [x] Energy Conversion
 - [x] Theme: Structure and function are correlated at all levels of biological organization (**1.12**)
 - [x] Theme: Cells are an organisms basic unit of structure and function
 - [x] Theme: The continuity of life is based on heritable information in the form of DNA
 - [x] DNA Structure and Function
 - [x] Systems Biology at Levels of Cells and Molecules
 - [x] Theme: Feedback mechanisms regulate bioligcal systems

#### 1.2 The Core Theme: Evolution accounts for the unity and diversity of life
- [x] Organizing the Diversity of Life
- [x] Grouping Species: The basic Idea
- [x] The Three Domains of Life
- [ ] Unity in the Diversity of Life
- [x] Charles Darwin and Theory of Natural Selection
- [x] The Tree of Life

#### 1.3 Scientists use two main forms of inquiry in their study of nature (**1.9**)
- [ ] Discovery of Science
- [ ] Types of Data
- [ ] Induction in Discovery Science
- [x] Hypothesis-Based Science
- [x] The Role of Hypotheses in Inquiry
- [x] Deduction: If...Then logic of Hypothesis

- [ ] The Myth of the Scientific Method
- [ ] A Case study in Scientific Inquiry: Investigating Mimicry in Snake Population
- [ ] Field Experiments with Artificial Snakes
- [ ] Designing Controlles Experiments
- [ ] Limitations of Science
- [ ] Theories in Science
- [ ] Model Building in Science
- [ ] The Culture of Science
- [ ] Science, Technology and Society **1.8**
